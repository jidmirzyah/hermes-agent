"""Store.fetch resume end-to-end: a dropped archive download resumes on the
second Store.fetch instead of re-fetching the whole archive.

A real loopback Range-honoring server, a real tar.gz, no urllib mocking.
The first fetch is cut short by the server closing the connection mid-body
(so Store.fetch raises); the second fetch must resume from the durable
byte-range prefix — requesting only the missing tail, not the whole archive —
and return bytes that exactly match the original tar.gz. The managed partials
live OUTSIDE the scratch tempdir (in the store's machine-scoped partials
area), so the scratch context's finally-rmtree cannot destroy resume state.
