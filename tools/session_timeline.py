"""Per-session, per-turn step timeline — a live "what's happening now" view.

Sibling to ``tools/delegation_live_log.py`` but general-purpose: not tied to
delegated children, it covers every tool call any session makes (bare CLI,
gateway, desktop). It reuses the *shape* of delegation's event contract
(``tool.started`` / ``tool.completed`` with ``duration`` / error outcome)
and its truncated, redacted, file-backed philosophy, but none of the
delegation-specific manifest/retention machinery — that part is genuinely
delegation-only (per-child directories, live tail-able .log files, a
7-day-retention manifest.json). This module instead keeps one small bounded
JSON document per session.

Storage: Hermes is multi-process — ``hermes_cli/web_server.py`` (the API)
runs separately from ``gateway/run.py`` (the live agent) and from bare CLI
sessions. An in-memory-only buffer in the API process would be blind to
gateway/CLI sessions, so each session's timeline is a file under
``cache/timeline/<session_id>.json``, written atomically (tmp + rename, the
same pattern used by ``hermes_cli/active_sessions.py`` and the durable
action records in ``hermes_cli/web_server.py``). Within the *recording*
process, a small in-memory ring buffer per session_id acts as a cache (so a
burst of tool calls doesn't require re-reading the file to look up the step
being closed out) — every mutation still flushes the full buffer to disk so
any other process reading the file sees current state. This mirrors the
"in-memory cache with file/durable fallback" pattern already used for
action-status reconciliation, and the bounded-collection convention of
``DashboardHealth._error_times`` (``deque(maxlen=...)``).

Status vocabulary intentionally matches the ``outcome`` values
``agent/tool_executor.py``'s ``emit_event("tool.completed", ...)`` calls
already use (``succeeded`` / ``failed`` / ``blocked``), plus ``running`` for
an in-flight step — no new terminology invented.

``args_digest``: built via ``agent.display.build_tool_preview()`` for shape
and truncation (per existing convention — do not reinvent that), then
additionally passed through ``agent.redact.redact_sensitive_text(force=True)``
as a safety net. This second pass is necessary, not optional:
``build_tool_preview()`` only redacts through
``redact_tool_args_for_display()``, which — as of this writing — redacts
exactly one case (``browser_type``'s ``text`` arg). A secret embedded in,
say, a ``terminal`` command argument passes through
``build_tool_preview()`` untouched (it only compacts/truncates via
``summarize_shell_command``, it does not scan for credentials). Since a
timeline entry is written to a session-scoped file that may be read back
over the dashboard API, it needs the same general-purpose redaction sweep
``tools/delegation_live_log.py`` applies to everything it writes.

``events.jsonl`` is deliberately untouched by this module — the timeline is
a separate, ephemeral, bounded, session-scoped view, not a durable audit
trail.

Design constraints (mirrors ``delegation_live_log.py``):

* **Never raise into the agent loop.** Every public function is wrapped in
  a broad except; failures are swallowed and debug-logged. A timeline write
  must never be able to break a real tool call.
* **Bounded.** Ring buffer capped at ``TIMELINE_MAX_STEPS`` entries per
  session; oldest evicted first (FIFO). ``step_n`` keeps counting up even
  past eviction, so callers can tell how many steps have happened in total.
* **No config knobs.** One module constant for the cap, same spirit as
  delegation's ``LIVE_RETENTION_DAYS``.
