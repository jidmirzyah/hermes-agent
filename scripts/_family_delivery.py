"""Identity -> Telegram delivery-target resolution for no-agent scripts.

Mirrors ``_google_identities.py``'s pattern (a small, explicit, per-identity
registry/resolver) but for platform delivery targets rather than Google
credentials. Reused by ``scripts/hermes-oauth-expiry-check.py`` so that job
never has to guess, hardcode, or default a reminder to the wrong person's
chat — the same failure mode as this system's real 2026-08-12 cross-person
data-disclosure incident.

Where the data comes from
--------------------------
Every identity's Telegram chat id is recorded in a ``telegram_chat_id``
field in that person's vault Profile.md YAML frontmatter (the ``---``
delimited block at the very top of the file), e.g.:

    ---
    status: canonical
    purpose: ...
    telegram_chat_id: "8758899353"  # read by hermes-oauth-expiry-check.py -- do not rename/remove
    ---

confirmed live for both identities that exist today:
  * jid     -> ``Hermes/Profile/JID Profile.md``
  * zarkash -> ``Hermes/Profile/Family/Zarkash/Zarkash Profile.md``

Why frontmatter instead of the "Platform Identity" markdown table (this
module's original design): the table lives in the file's prose body,
alongside content that gets edited far more often (bios, notes, relationship
history). Frontmatter is a structurally separate block at the top of the
file that normal profile edits have no natural reason to touch, which
meaningfully reduces the chance of an unrelated edit accidentally breaking
this field. The "Platform Identity" table is left in each Profile.md as the
human-readable record for people reading the file — it is no longer what
this module parses.

JID Profile.md's own text says these platform IDs are "the human-readable
mirror" of what's enforced at the gateway level (``config.yaml``'s
``telegram.allow_from``), "not a separate source of truth. If the two ever
disagree, config.yaml's live gateway config wins; flag the mismatch." This
module honors that explicitly: after parsing an id out of frontmatter, it
cross-checks the id is also present in ``config.yaml``'s
``telegram.allow_from`` and raises rather than delivers if the two
disagree, instead of trusting the vault file alone.

Path convention for a NEW identity (generality)
-------------------------------------------------
The **primary/master-user identity's** profile file name is a fixed
convention in this vault — this system has exactly one master user, and
their file has always been named ``JID Profile.md`` — so it is not derived
from the identity string (see ``_PRIMARY_PROFILE_RELATIVE_PATH`` below).
``is_primary_identity()`` (imported from the ``hermes-oauth-expiry-check``
job) already identifies this identity structurally, so no name comparison
is needed to pick this branch.

Every **non-primary (family-member) identity** follows one mechanical rule
that needs zero code changes for a new person:

    Hermes/Profile/Family/<Capitalized identity>/<Capitalized identity> Profile.md

e.g. ``zarkash`` -> ``Family/Zarkash/Zarkash Profile.md``. A new family
member added to ``_google_identities.py`` as, say, ``"aria"`` resolves
automatically to ``Family/Aria/Aria Profile.md`` — matching the exact
folder-naming convention already used for Zarkash — the moment their vault
folder exists with that name, a populated frontmatter block, and a
``telegram_chat_id`` field in it.
