"""Fast, named test set for the G1-G8 guarantees in Hermes/Governance/Update & Merge Policy.md.

TIERSYNC Step 7: run this alongside the existing behavior-level guarantee review, not instead of
it, until it has caught something real (see the TIERSYNC plan, Step 7). A gate that is too loose
manufactures false confidence -- every file below was individually read to confirm it actually
asserts the guarantee it is listed against, not picked by filename resemblance.

G1-G5 are test-driven and this script runs them. G6 and G8 are structural/policy checks that
cannot be reduced to a standalone pytest run against a snapshot of the tree (they are about
whether a *proposed change* touches a mechanism or applies cleanly, not a property of the tree at
rest) -- this script prints what to check by hand instead of faking a pass/fail. G7 runs `npm
audit` and reports the current count; it cannot determine "new" vulnerability without a stored
baseline, so it is reported, not gated.

Canonical guarantee text: read Hermes/Governance/Update & Merge Policy.md live, every run -- this
script's file lists are a snapshot verified against it on 2026-09-14 and will drift as the tree
changes.

Known gap: G5 ("config/skill loading integrity") has no single test file written specifically to
assert it, unlike G1-G4. The 30 files below are every test_config*.py / *config_migration*.py file
in the tree as of this writing -- broad coverage of config parsing/loading generally, not a
guarantee-specific test suite. Recommended follow-up: a dedicated test asserting the family
allowlist / group_allow_from / obsidian-vault-governance load path specifically.

Exit 0 if every G1-G5 test file passes. Exit 1 otherwise. Run:
  uv run python3 scripts/guarantee_gate.py

# individually, same spirit as G2 but mechanical rather than test-file-based. A curated test-file
# list is always one manifestation behind however the exclusion next gets reintroduced: confirmed
# via a full execution-log history read that it has recurred via at least 6 distinct mechanisms
# across 5 weeks (stray references, an entangled feature hunk, a wholesale-checkout data loss, a
# wire contract, a new upstream test file). Two tiers, like G1-G5 vs G6/G7 below: hard-gated
# patterns that should categorically never exist anywhere in the tree (any match is a real,
# unambiguous finding), and a reported-only count for the one pattern that legitimately appears in
# the fork's OWN blocklist/detection code and needs a human read rather than a mechanical gate.
# File-existence check: unambiguous, the module must categorically never be present, unlike a
# textual mention (this file's own docstring at tools/terminal_tool.py referenced the module name
# in a "companion modules" list years after the module itself was excluded and deleted -- found
# and fixed alongside this sweep, 2026-09-15 -- so a plain grep for the name is too broad).
