"""List the test files that carry a platforms() gate for a given platform.

Used by the marked-OS lane of ``.github/workflows/tests.yml`` to scope what
the macOS lane imports.

Why scope at all, when ``pytest -m platforms`` already selects correctly?
Because ``-m`` filters AFTER collection, and collection IMPORTS every test
module under ``tests/``. On the Linux lane that is fine (it runs them all
anyway), but on the macOS lane it would drag ~900 unrelated modules through
import on a host they were never expected to import on — one unrelated
ImportError would fail a job whose actual subject passed. Narrowing the
paths keeps each lane's failure signal about its own tests.

``-m platforms`` (plus the conftest's per-test host skips) remains the
authoritative selector: this script only decides which files get imported,
never which tests run. Over-selecting here is harmless (the skips drop the
extras); the failure mode to care about is UNDER-selecting, which is why
the workflow fails the job when zero tests end up selected.

A file matches when a quoted ``platforms("...")`` spec names the platform —
including negated (``"not macos"``) and any-of lists. The match is anchored
inside the string literal so bare identifiers (a variable named ``windows``)
don't produce false positives.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py macos [tests_root]

Prints one path per line (POSIX separators, repo-relative), sorted. Exits
non-zero when no file matches (a renamed spec or broken selection would
otherwise report a green lane that ran nothing).
