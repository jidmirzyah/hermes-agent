"""Check whether last night's async gateway restart actually completed.

sync-fork.sh (nightly, no_agent) pulls new commits into the live checkout
and then launches the gateway restart as a fully-detached background step
(sync-fork-restart-async.sh) so its own "I just synced N commits"
notification can be delivered before the restart has any chance to kill
the delivering process. Before launching that step it writes a
"scheduled" marker to ~/.hermes/cron/sync_fork_restart_state.json; the
detached step overwrites it with a final "healthy" or "failed" state on
completion.

This job runs a few minutes after hermes-sync-fork and reports on what
that marker says:

  - marker file doesn't exist -> nothing synced last night; silent
    (no_agent convention: empty stdout = no notification, nothing to see)
  - state == "scheduled" (never advanced) -> the detached restart step
    itself went missing -- alert, this is a real problem
  - state == "failed"    -> the detached step ran and hit an error --
    alert with the recorded reason
  - state == "healthy"   -> restart completed and gateway confirmed
    healthy -- silent, matches convention (JID doesn't need to be told
    the happy path happened)

The marker is archived (moved aside, never left in place) after being
read in any of the three "something existed" cases, so a stale result
from a previous night can never cause a false alert on a night nothing
happened.
