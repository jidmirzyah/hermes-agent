# Canonical test runner for hermes-agent. Run this instead of calling
# `pytest` directly to guarantee your local run matches CI behavior.
#
# One runner on every host: per-file subprocess isolation via
# scripts/run_tests_parallel.py — each test FILE runs in its own
# freshly-spawned `python -m pytest <file>` process. The spawn floor is
# ~15ms on POSIX; on Windows it is ~0.5-1.5s per file (a real cost,
# ~a 6-minute floor over the full suite, paid for the state isolation
# below). There is no cross-file state pollution and each file is
# collected exactly once (pytest's per-item fixture-closure machinery —
# tens of millions of dict walks over ~42k items against the conftest's
# autouse fixtures — is paid once, not once per worker; measured 37-65s
# of pure collection that a persistent-worker model multiplies by the
# worker count).
#
# Both paths enforce the same hermetic environment: TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8,
# PYTHONHASHSEED=0, `env -i` scrubbing (credential vars can't leak), and
# proper venv activation (probes .venv, venv, then ~/.hermes/...).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_tests.sh                            # full suite
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -j 4                       # cap workers/parallelism
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/               # discover only here
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py               # single file
#   scripts/run_tests.sh tests/foo.py -q            # path + bare pytest flag
#   scripts/run_tests.sh -k 'pattern'               # value flags pass through too

# ── Windows location variables (computed before we drop env) ───────────────
# `env -i` forwards HOME, which is enough on POSIX. Native Windows CPython
# resolves Path.home() from USERPROFILE (or HOMEDRIVE+HOMEPATH), stdlib
# platform paths come from LOCALAPPDATA/APPDATA, ssl/sockets need SYSTEMROOT,
# and tempfile needs TEMP/TMP. Dropping them breaks collection on native
# Windows (issues #67385, #70813). These are location variables, not
# credentials, so forwarding them keeps the isolation intent intact. Each is
# only forwarded when actually set, so POSIX runs are byte-for-byte unchanged.
#
# USERPROFILE is deliberately excluded from this passthrough: forwarding the
# real one is exactly the isolation hole this loop exists to avoid on native
# Windows, where Path.home() reads it directly. It is overridden below,
# alongside HERMES_TEST_HOME, instead. HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH are left pointing
# at the real profile on purpose -- Path.home() only falls back to them when
# USERPROFILE is unset, so once USERPROFILE is overridden they're inert for
# that resolution path, and other tools may still need the real values.

#     subprocess rebuild the 5GB image from a cold builder cache instead
#     (~4 min per worker per run, and the rebuilt image lacked the

#     default time — inside the stripped environment.

# ── Isolated HOME for the test run ─────────────────────────────────────────
# `env -i` below forwards HOME, and that has been the last hole in this
# script's isolation. Tests that reach a real install write into the
# developer's actual home: scripts/install.sh links node/npm/npx into
# "$(get_command_link_dir)", which is "$HOME/.local/bin", and npm caches into
# "$HOME/.npm". Both have been overwritten by test runs in practice.
#
# Point HOME at a stable directory instead. It is deliberately PERSISTENT, not
# a per-run tempdir: a fresh home every run would re-download ~50MB of Node
# each time. It must also not live under /var/tmp, which this host clears on a
# 30-day timer.
#
# Set HERMES_TEST_HOME to override. Setting it to your real $HOME is the
# deliberate opt-out.
#
# NOTE: on native Windows, POSIX HOME isolation alone doesn't cover
# Path.home() -- CPython resolves that from USERPROFILE there. Point
# USERPROFILE at the same isolated directory so a native Windows run gets the
# same protection this HOME override already gives POSIX (stopping writes
# into the real ~/.local/bin, ~/.npm). Only touched when USERPROFILE was
# actually set to begin with, so a POSIX run stays byte-for-byte unchanged.
# Native Windows was not testable where this was written; verification
# belongs on the CI lane's windows_only jobs, not asserted here.

# TMPDIR is forwarded when the caller sets it. run_tests_parallel.py reads it
# to place its per-file basetemp root ("Placed under the parent's TMPDIR (or
# the OS default) so it still lands on whatever disk-backed location the caller
# configured"), so stripping it silently defeated that design and sent every
# test temp tree to a RAM-backed /tmp. Measured peak there: 709MB of a 2.7GB
# tmpfs for one subdirectory of the suite.
#
# Keep any value SHORT. Some tests build AF_UNIX sockets under tmp_path, and
# sun_path is capped at 104/108 bytes; a deep TMPDIR reproduced "AF_UNIX path
# too long" when it was tried as a per-file override. A shallow disk root is
# fine -- verified against tests/tools/test_approved_command_clean_slate.py,
# the file that failure was found in.

# evicts the dev shell's python3/rg and makes terminal, process-registry,
# and ripgrep-backed search tests fail with exit 127 on NixOS hosts.
#
# HERMES_PYTHON_SRC_ROOT is the Nix dev shell's editable-install root: the
# venv's editable finder reads it at runtime to locate first-party modules.
# Stripping it breaks "import tools" in every test subprocess whose cwd is
# not the repo root (the import-guard probe runs from a tempdir).
