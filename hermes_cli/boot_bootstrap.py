"""Boot-time post-update bootstrap.

Every install kind (git checkout, desktop bundled payload, docker, nix)
compares two per-install facts at boot:

* current identity — the commit this install IS: ``install-stamp.json``
  for sealed trees, git HEAD for checkouts. Reading it is a couple of
  file reads (plus one rev-parse for checkouts).
* last-known identity — the commit this install last bootstrapped,
  recorded under ``installs/<sha16>/bootstrap/`` keyed by the canonical
  install root.

Equal → nothing happens (the fast path, ~2 ms). Different → run the
idempotent post-update steps from ``hermes_cli.post_update`` under a
single-flight lock, then record the new identity.

Two records, one per step scope:

* home record — ``bootstrap/<profile>.json``. Gates home-scoped steps.
  HERMES_HOME moves per profile, so each profile bootstraps its own
  state once per code change.
* machine record — ``bootstrap/machine.json``. Every profile resolves
  the same file, so machine-global steps run once per machine per code
  change and the record's lock serializes concurrent profile boots.

The records are an optimization, never the correctness layer: every step
is idempotent and self-gating, so a deleted record costs one redundant
slow path, nothing more.

Ported from the restack branch's boot_bootstrap, rewritten onto this
branch's vocabulary: stamps via ``hermes_cli.steward``, managed tools via
``pm`` (facts.json ledger) instead of the retired ``installation`` package.
